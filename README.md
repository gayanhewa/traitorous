Traitorous
==========

The hack-lang web framework with teeth!

Currently in super alpha. Theres tons of won't fixes being generated by
hh_client and some hacks around namespacing issues until they get fixed by
HHVM.

Hack is a new frontier, so we're dawning our outlaw hats and completely
ditching the hip trends in PHP and setting off down our own path.

Thoughts
--------

  * Declaritive code over imperative code.
  * Modular code over unwieldly code.
  * Type safety to the max.
  * Composition over inheritance.
  * Secure by default.
  * Correctness matters more then performance, but performance matters alot!
  * Heavy rethinking, refactoring and abuse of features and core libs.

Pioneering
----------

There will be a proper example application soon.
